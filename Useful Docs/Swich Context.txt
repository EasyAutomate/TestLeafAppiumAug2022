Session Created as a Native App
1. VDM (Vendor Specific Mechanism) will be in primarily interacting to device
2. I can identify the context available in screen
3. I can switch to any context
4. I can launch any installed app as a NATIVE only
5. If that app has a WebView context, then I should explicitly navigate to it (Switch to respecteve context)
6. If I switch to correct WebView, ChromeDriver would be interacting with device.
7. It can identify the respective page source and interact with it.
8. If I want to switch back to Native app, I can switch the context


Session Created as a Mobile Web
//Note: Chrome browser cannot be stopped unless session is killed
1. ChromeDriver will be in primarily interacting to device
//Below points are applicable only in recent versions i.e Appiem Server > 1.21 and java client >= 8.X
2. I can launch any installed app as a NATIVE only but focus would be still available in the previous webview/screen
3. If I need to interact with the app launched, then I should explicitly navigate to Native Context
4. Challenge : If the app is a Hybrid app, I will not have provision/permission to switch to Webview context inside the Hybrid app
